# AssetPricing
This repository aims to produce a simple Python pricer for various assets. It only implements equity assets for now but hopefully it will include others later on.
The final goal is to be able to extract data from yahoo finance (or others) and price asset accordingly. 
I used to have a few different scripts to price some basic options and my current objectives is to regroup all of them and adding new products or models using OOP.
This is obviously a fairly simple pricer that aims only for educational & learning purposes.

It currently allows to price EU & US options, as well as barrier option.
12/03 MC simulation for barrier option aren't working for now and will be uploaded later.

I've made some progress on implementing a local volatility model but not on Heston.
